# Javascript Introduction

**Javascript**

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

**Javascript Variables**

Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

**var**

Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

**let**

Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

**const**

Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

**Example**

```
var a;
console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined
a=25;
console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is 25
```

**Variable Declaration Rule**

-> Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

-> Names must begin with a letter.

-> Names can also begin with $.

-> Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).

-> Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
